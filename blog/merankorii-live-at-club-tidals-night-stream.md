Merankorii Live at Club Tidal's Night Stream

![Poster image for the festival](longestnight-sunset.svg)

Celebrating the shortest?/longest? night (depending on where you are in the
world), this year's Club Tidal solsice party is going to be a
[24 hours festival](https://sun.tidalcycles.org/), and my solo musical project
[Merankorii](https://merankorii.blogspot.com/) is going to participate by
playing Cycle #35 (if you're in Portugal, that will be at 21:20, on December
21).

As some of you know, Yule is when my birthday also is, so this is a special
celebration for me...

This online festival is going to be live streamed, so make sure to tune in
during this 24h period and celebrate the Solstice by witnessing to people from
all over the world livecoding sounds for your pleasure!
