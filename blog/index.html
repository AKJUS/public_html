<p>Probably more useful to users of <a href="https:/tilde.pt">tilde.pt</a>, but maybe others
of the <a href="https://tildeverse.org/">tildeverse</a> who speak more than one language
and use <a href="http://alpine.x10host.com/alpine/release/">alpine</a> as a mail client,
today wrote a very small shell script called
<a href="https://github.com/marado/multi-aspell">multi-aspell</a>.</p>

<p><code>multi-aspell</code> is an helper script that shows you a list of (pre-defined)
language options to run <a href="http://aspell.net/">aspell</a> with.</p>

<p>It was written with the purpose of replacing the aspell invocation from
alpine, in order to let you choose which language you want your e-mail to have
its spell checked (useful if you're used to write mails in more than one
language).</p>

<p>Now, before sending an email, alpine will ask me wether I want to spell check
it in Portuguese or English, and then use that language to check the e-mail
with.</p>

<p>Of course, comments, issues, patches or feature requests are more than welcome.
Enjoy!</p>

<p>Speaking yesterday with someone about <a href="https://tilde.pt">tilde.pt</a>, which he
found out about due to my contributions to
<a href="https://github.com/marado/botany">botany</a>, it took me a while but I did
realize that there is a generational issue recognizing a ~, or, in particular,
recognizing it as a way to refer to someone.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, before @username was the common way to refer to a person (who
came with that first? twitter?), ~username was so. UNIX users will still be
probably used to do things like <code>cd ~</code> to go to their <code>$HOME</code>, or even <code>~user</code>
to refer to some other person's home. But I do not think that's where the most
common <code>~</code> recognition comes from: instead, what people will most remember is
the number of websites of "white pages" (as some other person refered about
them to me as), that had, as an address, <code>http://institution/~username</code>.</p>

<p>So, where does this <code>~</code> come from? Well, there was a time where every machine
connected to the web was more or less expected to have <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/">Apache's
httpd</a> running, and it had a useful module, called
<code>mod_userdir</code>. UserDir actually was inherited: Apache's httpd started in 1995
as a continuation of the NCSA HTTPd webserver, and NCSA not only had the
UserDir directive, it was actually <a href="http://www6.uniovi.es/~antonio/ncsa_httpd/setup/srm/UserDir.html">active by
default</a>.
What does all this means? Well, it means that, by default, UNIX machines with a
webserver running would probably have NCSA or later Apache's httpd, which, by
default, would be allowing each of that server's users to have their own
website, at the address http://server.address/~username , and to have something
in there they'd just have to put some html pages into their <code>public_html</code>
directory.</p>

<p>This is not my first blog, so it is also not my first blog post, but... it is
the first post of my new blog, and, well, it is costumary to make an hello
world sort of blog post, so here's mine.</p>

<p>I am not a fan of blogs: I never was, even when I maintained quite regularly a
personal blog in the past. But it seems that blogs are the new trend on the
<a href="https://tildeverse.org/">tildeverse</a>, and, well, I guess I'll stop tild'ing
like it was the nineties, and get do it like it was the 2000's again.</p>

<p>Do not expect this to be updated very often... or at all. But... well, not even
I know exactly what I expect this tilde of mine to become, so I guess we'll
find out together!</p>
