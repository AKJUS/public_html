<p><em>Pensei fazer um tweet, e quando dei conta tinha monologado uma <a href="https://twitter.com/mind_booster/status/1259129049164775426">thread bem
grande</a>. Para
facilitar a sua leitura, decidi publicar essa thread aqui.</em></p>

<p>O Ricardo Lafuente escreve mais um interessantíssimo
<a href="https://tilde.pt/~rlafuente/blog/pensar-antes-de-instalar.html">artigo</a> no seu
blog, desta vez sobre Contact Tracing.</p>

<p>Todo o artigo é bom (e leitura recomendada), mas gosto principalmente por estas
duas frases que, em meu entender, são as que metem o dedo bem mesmo na ferida:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Seria ótimo termos em mãos a informação sobre o que se pretende implementar
em Portugal, mas não existe ainda qualquer documento formal a descrever o que
se está a preparar, apenas comentário de imprensa.
Não pode ser assim, se estamos a falar de uma decisão sócio-política com
implicações que ainda não conseguimos quantificar enquanto sociedade, mas
cujo desfecho definirá as nossas existências nos tempos que aí vêm.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A meu ver, não podemos continuar a estar nesta situação em que aparentam
estarem a testarem-se águas sobre várias soluções e a tentar formar opinião
pública, sem que todas as cartas sejam postas em cima da mesa. É assim que
temos coisas como <a href="https://twitter.com/decoproteste/status/1258350951653670913">este artigo da
DECO</a>, ao mesmo
tempo que temos a admissão, mesmo dos proponentes deste tipo de apps, que, na
realidade, a privacidade não está garantida, apesar dos riscos estarem
minimizados (supostamente: nos promenores, encontram-se diversos compromissos a
serem tomados mas várias soluções).</p>

<p>O artigo da DECO tb é apresentado como "país quer ARCs", quando na realidade os
números que lá se vêm falam do inverso: afinal, "a maioria" pouco importa neste
discurso, menos de 60% da população se voluntaria para o uso, e sem 60% estas
apps são inúteis, dizem os estudos.</p>

<p>De notar que, pelo que se vai sabendo <a href="https://jpn.up.pt/2020/04/30/covidapp-e-stayaway-duas-apps-portuguesas-que-rastream-casos-de-covid-19/">pela
imprensa</a>,
a "app oficial", apoiada pelo Governo, será a StayAway, do INESC TEC. Mais uma
vez, só se sabe dessa app o que vai <a href="https://eco.sapo.pt/2020/05/04/esta-app-vai-dizer-lhe-se-esteve-perto-de-alguem-com-covid-19-saiba-como-vai-funcionar/">aparecendo na
imprensa</a>,
mas já com detalhes que levantam muitas questões.</p>

<p>Mas será mesmo assim? Urge que o Governo seja claro e transparente. Vai mesmo
adoptar uma ferramenta? Haverá ainda espaço para o debate público sobre esta
matéria? A adoptar, será mesmo a StayAway? Se sim, há ainda espaço para debate
sobre as decisões de arquitectura da solução?</p>

<p>Urge termos respostas para estas perguntas. Até lá, será útil ler o <a href="https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/public-policy/europe-tpc-contact-tracing-statement.pdf">artigo de
ontem da
ACM</a>
sobre o tema. Destaco três frases:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No known tracing applications can fully preserve individual privacy and
anonymity, while multiple technical issues hinder the ability to prove or
assume the apps' accuracy.</p>

<p>Moreover, high technical quality and functionality are insufficient for
ensuring their efficacy.</p>

<p>Mechanisms should be employed for seeking the public’s and civil society
representatives’ comment on proposed contact tracing technology and all
aspects of its intended deployment.</p>
</blockquote>

Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing -- is it really?

<p>DP-3T, as it is known, stands for Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing. It tries to be a decentralized, privacy-preserving solution to a problem: to make phone applications help mitigate the current COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>OK, let me take a step back. There have been talks (and in some contries already actions) about having an app to use phones in order to help track down the spread of COVID-19. I am not focused, in this article, to argue that the idea, in general is bad (tip: I think it is, due to privacy concerns), or to point out that relying on big companies like Google or Apple to "take care of it" using closed and opaque methods is a really bad idea (tip: it should be obvious: it is). I also don't plan to discuss what is each country proposing, adopting, or doing: not even the Portuguese case, where the Prime Minister and President announce they are against geolocalization, one week later the same Prime Minister consider it a possible solution, and one other week later the adoption of a platform for that is announced. I am not even focused on the discussion between the adoption of DP-3T or one of the proposals of PEPP-PT: much was already written about it, and if you still don't know that DP-3T is a better design than any of the PEPP-PT endorsed solutions.</p>

<p>Instead, this article is about something I didn't see yet anything making the case for: DP-3T, the best protocol/architecture for a solution out there, claims to be Privacy-Preserving. But is it?</p>

<h3>Not yet</h3>

<p>My first take on this issue is to consider DP-3T as it is right now. It is, we understand, an ever-evolving specification, that, due to the time constraints inherent to the demand for applications of this sort, need to adopt a 'release early, release often' approach. Still, in the moment I am writting this, there are <a href="https://github.com/DP-3T/documents/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22privacy+risk%22">14 open issues to the spec tagged as 'privacy risks'</a>. Privacy, like security, or life, in certain cases is quite binary: there only needs to be one privacy issue with a certain protocol, format or tool, to make it not be privacy-preserving, so the answer to the question of DP-3T is privacy perserving is... "not yet."</p>

<h3>Not really</h3>

<p>But is that it? If you take a closer look, things get even grimmer. From the "privacy risk" issues previously opened and now closed on the project, we can see that several of them (nine, at this moment) were closed because they stopped having input. While a manual reading of each of them will show a status of them, and most of them were dealt (partially or entirely) one way or another, the struggle of the maintainers of the project to keep the number of issues low is clear, the reference to future versions of the documents leave things unclear of wether the issues have been addressed or not, and the way some things are not solved, but only mitigated shows that there is a "best effort" sort of approach to privacy, the idea that "let's see how privacy-preserving can we be in a rushing development cycle", instead of what it should be: a firm stance that no privacy-risk can exist in a privacy-preserving solution.</p>

<p>I do understand that the critic here so far is vague enough that one could argue that we're still on the 'not yet' field: after all, after all the privacy-related issues are closed, after all the documents still being prepared are published, one can go through all of those issues, check the latest version of the document, and verify if all of the privacy issues were indeed solved. Arguably, they could. But we do not need to stay on the theoretical field here, not when the "best effort" approach, even in partial sacrifice of privacy, is actually documented. My favorite example of this, is the <a href="https://github.com/DP-3T/documents/blob/master/FAQ.md#p5-why-not-use-mixnets-or-other-anonymous-communication-systems-to-query-the-server">FAQ's 5th point</a>, about the use of anonymous communication systems.</p>

<h4>Why not use mixnets or other anonymous communication systems to query the server?</h4>

<p>In the answer to this question, DP-3T stipulates, first, that this is a valid question and concern. Then, they explain that they decided not to for three reasons: a solution would increase complexity, anonymity would cost latency and bandwidth, and it would widen the field of research necessary to take protocol decisions.</p>

<p>In the end, the answer is a claim that there currently is no system ready to use DP-3T could piggy back on and simply use to this purpose, mature enough to the scale DP-3T aims to be deployed -- if there was, they'd use it.</p>

<p>While I do not disagree - such anonymous communication system is a need we, as a society, have for a long time, but an itch we did never focus on scratching, and the solutions so far are far from a stable and consolidated state - I also believe that this is clear proof that DP-3T is, by design, not 'Privacy-Preserving', but only 'as Privacy-Preserving as we can be, with these time constraints'.</p>

<h3>Why does it matter?</h3>

<p>The difference between "private" and "as private as possible" is not small, no matter how tiny it is: it is the difference between a solution that respects your privacy, and a solution that doesn't. While I can understand DP-3T and its interesting properties as an academic project, it is, IMO, a dangerous assumption to think that, because this is the best someone has came up to, that it is good enough for us, and that we should adopt it. In fact, my belief is that, since DP-3T is the best we aim to be able to achieve during this outbreak, it should <em>not</em> be used. On the other hand, this can and should be used as a learning experience, proof that there is a need to serious public investment on the development of <em>real</em> Privacy-Preserving technologies, of which anonymous communication systems are just an example.</p>

<h3>What could have been</h3>

<p>This article is long enough already, and I could go on and on about what can be done, if the serious effort is made to make it happen. The first paper I wrote about <a href="https://gnunet.org/">GNUnet</a> was more than 15 years ago: since then many things have happened, extraordinary developments in many technological fields, a decade and half has passed... but GNUnet seems to me as being still the most promising privacy-centric project out there, and, quite unfortunately, it is still in an early alpha stage. The latest incarnation of its website has a tagline that is quite fitting for this article: "The Internet of tomorrow needs GNUnet today". In 2020, technology failed us in many ways: when a worldwide event like COVID-19 hit, we searched for technological solutions that still did not exist. 2020 was tomorrow, and we did not have GNUnet (or any other solution of choice -- take your pick, there is plenty around to do). My biggest fear on this subject is not to see solutions like DP-3T (or worse) being adopted, affecting the privacy of real lives, real people. My biggest fear that we will step out of the current sittuation, and decide not to learn from the evidences of past mistakes. Let's build the Internet of tomorrow, now.</p>

<p>Probably more useful to users of <a href="https:/tilde.pt">tilde.pt</a>, but maybe others
of the <a href="https://tildeverse.org/">tildeverse</a> who speak more than one language
and use <a href="http://alpine.x10host.com/alpine/release/">alpine</a> as a mail client,
today wrote a very small shell script called
<a href="https://github.com/marado/multi-aspell">multi-aspell</a>.</p>

<p><code>multi-aspell</code> is an helper script that shows you a list of (pre-defined)
language options to run <a href="http://aspell.net/">aspell</a> with.</p>

<p>It was written with the purpose of replacing the aspell invocation from
alpine, in order to let you choose which language you want your e-mail to have
its spell checked (useful if you're used to write mails in more than one
language).</p>

<p>Now, before sending an email, alpine will ask me wether I want to spell check
it in Portuguese or English, and then use that language to check the e-mail
with.</p>

<p>Of course, comments, issues, patches or feature requests are more than welcome.
Enjoy!</p>

<p>Speaking yesterday with someone about <a href="https://tilde.pt">tilde.pt</a>, which he
found out about due to my contributions to
<a href="https://github.com/marado/botany">botany</a>, it took me a while but I did
realize that there is a generational issue recognizing a ~, or, in particular,
recognizing it as a way to refer to someone.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, before @username was the common way to refer to a person (who
came with that first? twitter?), ~username was so. UNIX users will still be
probably used to do things like <code>cd ~</code> to go to their <code>$HOME</code>, or even <code>~user</code>
to refer to some other person's home. But I do not think that's where the most
common <code>~</code> recognition comes from: instead, what people will most remember is
the number of websites of "white pages" (as some other person refered about
them to me as), that had, as an address, <code>http://institution/~username</code>.</p>

<p>So, where does this <code>~</code> come from? Well, there was a time where every machine
connected to the web was more or less expected to have <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/">Apache's
httpd</a> running, and it had a useful module, called
<code>mod_userdir</code>. UserDir actually was inherited: Apache's httpd started in 1995
as a continuation of the NCSA HTTPd webserver, and NCSA not only had the
UserDir directive, it was actually <a href="http://www6.uniovi.es/~antonio/ncsa_httpd/setup/srm/UserDir.html">active by
default</a>.
What does all this means? Well, it means that, by default, UNIX machines with a
webserver running would probably have NCSA or later Apache's httpd, which, by
default, would be allowing each of that server's users to have their own
website, at the address http://server.address/~username , and to have something
in there they'd just have to put some html pages into their <code>public_html</code>
directory.</p>
