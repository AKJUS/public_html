Happy 20th birthday, ANSOL!

Today we celebrated the 20th anniversary of [ANSOL](https://ansol.org), the Portuguese Free Software Association. It has been an honor to be part of the history of this still young association, and here's hope for an active 20 years more - I'll gladly celebrate its 40th!

In these past 20 years, ANSOL worked on many issues, but if I had to highlight 3, I'd point out:

* the fight [against Software Patents in Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_directive_on_the_patentability_of_computer-implemented_inventions#Opponents_of_the_proposal) - which stopped (or stalled?) software patents;
* the [Open Standards Law in Portugal](https://www.dn.pt/opiniao/opiniao-dn/convidados/normas-abertas-fantasmas-e-a-formula-midi-1776429.html) - ahead of the curve;
* the [Portuguese anti-DRM law](https://fsfe.org/news/2019/news-20191113-01.en.html).

But there are many more challenges ahead... and our victories aren't closed books.

* The Unified Patent Court in Europe is [about to become a reality](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/only-one-more-ratification-needed-4189294/), and with it Software Patents;
* The Open Standards Law in Portugal exists, but [in practice it is isn't being actually applied](https://shifter.pt/2021/02/lei-das-normas-abertas/);
* And while we have a good protection against DRM in law (as far as we can within the EU, thanks to InfoSoc), there is now a [covert attempt to water it down]( https://twitter.com/mind_booster/status/1443250573147623424).

So, what now? Well, there is plenty to do: we should ensure we don't loose the Freedoms we have achieved, and we should strive to get those we still didn't get.

*There is plenty more to do, and you can help.*

If you're in Portugal, [join ANSOL](https://ansol.org/inscricao). If you're in Europe, FSFE will appreciate your [contribution](https://fsfe.org/contribute/contribute.en.html). If you're in Latin America, [here's your link](http://fsfla.org/ikiwiki/about/participate.en.html). In India, join [here](https://fsf.org.in/volunteer/). Based in North America, with worldwide mission, there's [FSF](https://fsf.org/associate/).

Of course, as we could see in those who have joined ANSOL in today's celebration, there is plenty beyond the realm of software. Consider getting to know [Wikimedia Portugal](https://pt.wikimedia.org) or the [Wikimedia Foundation](https://wikimediafoundation.org/), [Direitos Digitais](https://direitosdigitais.pt/) in Portugal and [EDRI](https://edri.org/) in Europe or [EFF](https://www.eff.org/) overseas.

Let's shape the future, together.
