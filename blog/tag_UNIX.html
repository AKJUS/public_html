<p>Speaking yesterday with someone about <a href="https://tilde.pt">tilde.pt</a>, which he
found out about due to my contributions to
<a href="https://github.com/marado/botany">botany</a>, it took me a while but I did
realize that there is a generational issue recognizing a ~, or, in particular,
recognizing it as a way to refer to someone.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, before @username was the common way to refer to a person (who
came with that first? twitter?), ~username was so. UNIX users will still be
probably used to do things like <code>cd ~</code> to go to their <code>$HOME</code>, or even <code>~user</code>
to refer to some other person's home. But I do not think that's where the most
common <code>~</code> recognition comes from: instead, what people will most remember is
the number of websites of "white pages" (as some other person refered about
them to me as), that had, as an address, <code>http://institution/~username</code>.</p>

<p>So, where does this <code>~</code> come from? Well, there was a time where every machine
connected to the web was more or less expected to have <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/">Apache's
httpd</a> running, and it had a useful module, called
<code>mod_userdir</code>. UserDir actually was inherited: Apache's httpd started in 1995
as a continuation of the NCSA HTTPd webserver, and NCSA not only had the
UserDir directive, it was actually <a href="http://www6.uniovi.es/~antonio/ncsa_httpd/setup/srm/UserDir.html">active by
default</a>.
What does all this means? Well, it means that, by default, UNIX machines with a
webserver running would probably have NCSA or later Apache's httpd, which, by
default, would be allowing each of that server's users to have their own
website, at the address http://server.address/~username , and to have something
in there they'd just have to put some html pages into their <code>public_html</code>
directory.</p>
