My very first blog post... again

This is not my first blog, so it is also not my first blog post, but... it is
the first post of my new blog, and, well, it is costumary to make an hello
world sort of blog post, so here's mine.

I am not a fan of blogs: I never was, even when I maintained quite regularly a
personal blog in the past. But it seems that blogs are the new trend on the
[tildeverse](https://tildeverse.org/), and, well, I guess I'll stop tild'ing
like it was the nineties, and get do it like it was the 2000's again.

Do not expect this to be updated very often... or at all. But... well, not even
I know exactly what I expect this tilde of mine to become, so I guess we'll
find out together!
