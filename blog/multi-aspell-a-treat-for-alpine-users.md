multi-aspell: a treat for alpine users

Probably more useful to users of [tilde.pt](https:/tilde.pt), but maybe others
of the [tildeverse](https://tildeverse.org/) who speak more than one language
and use [alpine](http://alpine.x10host.com/alpine/release/) as a mail client,
today wrote a very small shell script called
[multi-aspell](https://github.com/marado/multi-aspell).

`multi-aspell` is an helper script that shows you a list of (pre-defined)
language options to run [aspell](http://aspell.net/) with.

It was written with the purpose of replacing the aspell invocation from
alpine, in order to let you choose which language you want your e-mail to have
its spell checked (useful if you're used to write mails in more than one
language).

Now, before sending an email, alpine will ask me wether I want to spell check
it in Portuguese or English, and then use that language to check the e-mail
with.

Of course, comments, issues, patches or feature requests are more than welcome.
Enjoy!
