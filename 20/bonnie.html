		<h1>Project Closed</h1>
			Bonnie Suite was made as an academical work, and now
			it's authors don't have the time to maintain it as it needs. Nowadays you have
			<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=4207&amp;package_id=10010">better sollutions</a>, 
			so there's no point to keep developing this project. If you
			still want to, you can read the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220416194413/http://bonniesuite.sourceforge.net/old.html">old webpage</a>, but we
			recomment you to _not_ use Bonnie Suite.
