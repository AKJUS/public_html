			Three Candles

		As three candles illuminate my paper,
		Three lifes come to one by me.
		Three? The elementarial number?

		As born, grow up, die.
		As the moon, the stars, the sky.
		As my pen, the paper and myself.

		One is yellow, ornamented,
		Like sweet dreams should be,		
		And me, guided by thee.

		Other is red, in a flower,
		Like Love and Death,
		As you and me.

		The last one is green,
		Like Imbolc, like grass,
		How things should be beautifull, not a mess.

		And, looking through my mind,
		I wonder why they claim their 6 6 6.
		I claim, yes. I claim my 3 3 3.
