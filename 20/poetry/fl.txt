Falling Leaves

A leaf falls . . .
 from an errant elbow's downward thrust;
  toppled burgundy christens snowy linen
   and the dodging laps of suits and gowns.

   A leaf falls . . .
    to an eager reader's sudden frustration
     at a maddening mystery's imminent unveiling
      on a time-loosened final page.

      A leaf falls . . .
       amid blazing autumn glory unseen
        by dodgers of life's indoor spills
	 and chasers of fanciful mysteries.
