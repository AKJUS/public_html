      a dream I had:</font><font color="magenta" size="4"><br>
      </font></font></i><font color="magenta" size="4" face="Bradley Hand ITC"><br>
      A butterfly,<br>
      Fluttered by,<br>
      And, so fascinated I,<br>
      With its pure beauty,<br>
      That, mid-flit,<br>
      I cupped my hands,<br>
      To capture it.<br>
      <br>
      Stilled in my hands,<br>
      It fluttered quick, and,<br>
      I felt something,<br>
      Did brush my palms,<br>
      With gentle wing.<br>
      <br>
      Sweet lullabies,<br>
      Did I sing,<br>
      To calm and comfort,<br>
      Her being.<br>
      <br>
      But her beauty,<br>
      I desired,<br>
      And, it could not,<br>
      Be admired,<br>
      Trapped inside a finger cage,<br>
      However gently it was arranged,<br>
      So I slowly opened up to see,<br>
      In wondrous, shimmering gossamer,<br>
      She.<br>
      <br>
      And I saw, she partly be,<br>
      Born butterfly and part faerie,<br>
      For a moment she gazed at me,<br>
      In scintillating reverie,<br>
      And a sparkling I could see,<br>
      In her fine dress of filigree.<br>
      <br>
      With the slightest fairy pout,<br>
      She slyly turned our roles about,<br>
      She gave a look that captured me,<br>
      She smiled and slowly, fluttered free.<br>
      <br>
      That was my dream, it said to me,<br>
      That the butterfly fairies must fly free.<br>
      <br>
      Hard to find and hard to hold,<br>
      Theirs is a gift of purest gold,<br>
      As you set their spirits free,<br>
      When from your hands they unfold.<br>
      <br>
      If your nectar is kept sweet,<br>
      And for her, you endless yearn,<br>
      She shall make your joy complete,<br>
      When every day, she does return.<br>
      <br>
      The moral, here told<br>
      Clear and true,<br>
      What you capture,<br>
      Captures you.
