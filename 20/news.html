2ND CIRCUIT COURT ASKS FOR 1ST AMENDMENT CLARIFICATION ON DECSS CASE! See all the story <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010512102734/http://www.2600.com/news/display.shtml?id=410">here</a>!

ZDNet reported yesterday that VBS.VBSWG2, otherwise known as 'Homepage' has
                           surfaced at scores of companies, and is likely to hit more firms today. The
email
                           attachment (homepage.html.vbs) uses similar code to the Kournikova worm
                           which spread quickly in February. In fact, according to F-Secure's website,
it was
                           written with the same virus kit. 

                           This virus is a new version of something we've all seen before. Graham
Cluley,
                           head of research at Sophos, is quoted as saying: "It's not even a
particularly
                           clever bit of social engineering," he says. "It just says 'this is cool'." He
goes on
                           to note that what is most disturbing about the success of this worm is that
many
                           companies are still not blocking Visual Basic attachments--they could easily
do
                           so with basic filtering technology. Not to mention that Microsoft has had a
patch
                           for this type of problem since June. In other words, come on folks, this is
old
                           news. This particular game we already know how to win. See it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010512102734/http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2716955,00.html?chkpt=zdhpnews01">here</a>!

The Secure Digital Music Initiative is a coalition of technology companies and major record companies
formed to
                  develop a watermarking standard for music, so that it may be tracked and its use
controlled. SDMI will do to
                  music what the Content Scrambling System does to DVDs. Since the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act makes it a
                  crime to circumvent such measures, content providers can essentially use technology to
dictate what is legally
                  permissible, not just what is technically possible. 

                  Last September, SDMI announced "HackSDMI," a public challenge to attack proposed
watermarking schemes with a
                  $10,000 prize. In general, public hacking contests are ill-conceived, unscientific,
and don't really prove
                  anything. Several groups, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, called for a
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010512102734/http://www.eff.org/IP/Audio/SDMI/20000929_eff_hacksdmi_revised_boycott.html">boycott</a> of
HackSDMI -
                  urging the public not to undermine their own rights by participating. 
By November, researchers from Princeton and Rice Universities <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010512102734/http://www.cs.princeton.edu/sip/sdmi/announcement.html">announced</a> that they had successfully
broken four
                  of the content-control schemes. However, they declined to claim any prize money, as
doing so would have required
                  signing a non-disclosure statement. Having completed their academic research, the
group didn't participate in
                  the final rounds of the contest, as it offered no new information. Princeton professor
Edward Felten intended to
                  present their paper, entitled "Reading Between the Lines: Lessons from the SDMI
Challenge," at the Fourth
                  International Information Hiding Workshop yesterday. Instead he read a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010512102734/http://www.cs.princeton.edu/sip/sdmi/sdmimessage.txt">statement</a> explaining why he could not. 

                  Apparently, the scheme from Verance Corporation is already being used, and they fear
that if the attack is
                  published, people will be able to circumvent it. Good thing they have the faithful
DMCA on hand. It seems that
                  they don't think that DMCA's extremely narrow and burdensome encryption research
exception protects Dr. Felten.
                  The RIAA, SDMI, and Verance have threatened to sue under the DMCA if the paper is
presented. It isn't source
                  code, it isn't a program, it's just a paper that explains scientific research - and it
is being censored. While
                  we are still busy fighting the last bullet we took from the DMCA, our friends at the
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010512102734/http://cryptome.org/">cryptome</a> have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010512102734/http://cryptome.org/sdmi-attack.htm">published</a> the
                  threatening letters and the paper. If the precedents set by Judge Kaplan in the DeCSS
case stand, some day we
                  may not even be able to link to such things.

A team of computer hackers has captured &#163;35,000 ($AU99,000) for hacking
into a computer system just 24-hours after the competition began.

The hack is likely to be a major embarrassment for the company behind
the high-profile hacking comptetion, despite its assertion that the break
in has highlighted a major new vulnerability in the Solaris operating
system running on Intel x86 microprocessors.

Argus Systems organised the competition - to break into a Web server
locked down using its security product called PitBull - to promote its
products and to coincide with the start of Infosec, the UK's premier
computer security event.

Hackers were invited to circumvent PitBull, which automatically secures
known vulnerabilities and restricts activity at the operating system
level, and deface two functional - but fictitious - company Web sites.


The hacking group - Last Stage of Delirium (LSD) - broke into the target
server just a day after the competition began and informed Argus Systems.
The target server was shut down as the company immediately launched an
investigation.
