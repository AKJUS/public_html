One of the basic beliefs most everyone seems to share is that once you're
acquitted of a crime, you're freed of any penalty associated with that
crime. But we're learning that, at least in the United States, that's not
really the case. 

In a decision issued Wednesday in Philadelphia, Judge Gary S. Glazer
denied a motion by 2600 layout artist ShapeShifter (Terrence McGuckin) to
have the full amount of his bail returned. McGuckin was arrested last
August during the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia. All
charges were either dropped or found to be without merit. 

McGuckin had been held on half a million dollars bail and was imprisoned
for a week. Eventually the bail was reduced to $100,000 which meant that
ten percent of that in cash would be enough to get him released. 2600
staffers scrambled to raise the money and, on August 8, McGuckin was
finally released. 

McGuckin's trial was held on November 14 but the bail money - intended to
ensure a defendant's presence in court, was not returned. Even after the
appeal on the two remaining charges which were quickly found to not have
any merit whatsoever, the bail money remained with the authorities - no
doubt gathering interest somewhere. 

Wednesday's hearing was an attempt to get the full amount
returned. The judge refused, allowing $750 to be kept for administrative
costs. Ironically, it was the same judge who threw out the remaining
charges back in May. 

To us, this is nothing short of state-sanctioned theft. What kind of
message does it send if authorities can arrest people for invalid charges
and then have it paid for by their victims, even after they're found to be
entirely innocent? How many other times has this been allowed to
happen? In this case, the authorities caused tremendous damage yet were
never held entirely accountable. They squashed legal demonstrations,
intimidated and assaulted innocent people, and behaved in much the same
manner that we would expect to see in an undemocratic society. And now
they've been rewarded for it. 

This is a development that nobody can be proud of.

Privacy advocates are incensed over an AltaVista announcement today regarding the impending release of a software
product that allows personal information to be searched on employees' computers. According to the Associated Press, "The
AltaVista software is based on the premise that businesses operating in an information-driven era will be better off if
more employees can sift through a community storehouse of data gathered from corporate intranets, workers' e-mail boxes
and PC hard drives." The legal ramifications of this kind of product have already come in to question. Not a
particularly good sign considering the product hasn't even been released yet.
