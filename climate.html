(A) Climate Crisis Timeline

1963 - First meeting of experts concerned with global warming
1972 - "The Limits of Growth", from an international team of researchers at MIT, is published
1979 - Scientific report suggests that doubling emissions might lead us to an 1.5-4.5C global warming
1989 - Fossil idustry claims the science about global warming is uncertain
1991 - The first IPCC report provides certain science about global warming
1992 - Framework Convention Agreement aims greenhouse gas emissions stabilized at 1990 levels by 2000
1997 - Kyoto protocol is agreed, with targets needed to "prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system"
2000 - emissions did not stabilize but instead raised 10.2%
2005 - Kyoto Protocol is only now effective, first period to be 2008-2012
2010 - Emissions soared 32% between 2000 and 2010
2012 - Kyoto's first period ends, the dangers weren't prevented. More needs to be done, several countries don't want to
2016 - Paris Agreement becomes effective: emissions need to be cut by roughly 50%, temp +1.5C, by 2030, net-zero in 2050
2019 - Year by Year, emissions keep rising
2021 - IPPC report: to keep below 1.5Â°C, the world needs to halve annual greenhouse gas emissions in the next eight years
2022 - Predicted Carbon Budget points to the need to achieve net-zero by 2040 in order to peak at 1.5C

--- present

2030 - Following the Paris Agreement, by 2030 global warming should hopefully be under 1.5C, definitively 2.0C
2040 - limit date for net-zero in order to peak at 1.5C, according to 2022's Carbon Budget
2050 - Following the Paris Agreement, by 2050 we should have achieved net-zero emissions

		Curious to know what is this all about? Well, denial apparently
		is a modern thing, and <a href=".">I</a>'m tired of having to face more and
		more climate crisis deniers... so, this timeline is here to
		give prespective - mostly to give <i>me</i> prespective.
		Humanity is facing its biggest challenge ever, and we're doing
		it with our eyes closed and our heads in our pillows.
