2021-01-28T13:59:43Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<nkrjalq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=nkrjalq>) Cool! I haven't followed what has been going on in twtland for a while. Can you please share links to jenny and tt?
2021-11-09T20:02:52Z	Goryon - the twtxt mobile app - is making me think about hosting a yarn pod - just so I can use it while keeping my (real, self-hosted) twtxt "account". I wonder if there's an easy way to host a lightweight, single-user version of the endpoint… or if there's documentation about how to write one.
2021-11-10T10:38:16Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#hfal6kq) So, there is an API! This is offtopic for the thread (sorry) but can you link me to its documentation? I'm thinking about creating a single-user barebones "pod", compatible with the mobile app but that manages a single twtxt file.
2021-11-10T20:02:01Z	@<darch https://twtxt.net/user/darch/twtxt.txt> (#hzrblbq) Great stuff, thanks! That does solve my "publishing" part of the equation, even if it still doesn't work as a client (either web or mobile)…
2021-11-10T20:37:02Z	@lyse @<darch https://twtxt.net/user/darch/twtxt.txt> @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> @<thecanine https://twtxt.net/user/thecanine/twtxt.txt> @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#hfal6kq) Seems to me that the sync is only useful if it allows a lot more editing (eventually even a complete rewrite). Which I am all for, but then the edit/deletion restriction on the UI becomes sort of an hassle, as someone more tech-savvy will be able to do things that less tech-savvy users will not…
2021-11-11T10:47:29Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#hzrblbq) yes, functionally an yarnd with --single-user is all/exactly what I'm seeking.  Technically I'd then probably still want a port/clone of it into a lighter-weight, easilly hostable alternative (so you can file-drop into any tilde host, or even those FTP-only hostings…), but that's a bridge to cross when I get there…
2021-11-11T22:12:48Z	@lyse @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> (#te2mlfa) damn, now I'm sad that the way they do it doesn't really follow the twtxt format…

2022-04-25T18:53:29Z	According to some on twitter (see https://twitter.com/disclosetv/status/1518662153343057923?t=HAwtAoxkxZ-H6E8Px7qq1w&s=19 as an example), twitter share trading has halted, and the announcement of Musk buying Twitter is imminent.  I'm a little disappointed to not see more people talking about twtxt as an alternative to twitter…

2022-05-07T00:32:14Z	Hey @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>, https://dev.twtxt.net/doc/archivefeedsextension.html allows only for a prev filename but not a full URL. Is there any reason why? Even for non-self-hosters, being able to point to a new domain would be good for interoperability, right?
2022-05-07T09:22:51Z	(#opev6mq) I'm uncertain I'm looking at the right place, but from how I read it, absolute URLs not only aren't mandated, they aren't even a possibility. I'll open a PR soon(TM)
2022-05-07T09:33:50Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> here's another question (sorry!), is something wrong going on with the feeds service? https://feeds.twtxt.net/twitter-mind_booster/twtxt.txt does not seem to be updated since January (but the source is...)
2022-05-07T10:12:07Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#nsmsvfq) 😥 It might be worth doing it via twitter's API... but since I'm not volunteering to implement it, I'll just remain sad :-P
2022-05-07T23:02:26Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> (#nsmsvfq) awesome tip!
2022-05-07T23:06:42Z	@<anx https://twtxt.net/user/anx/twtxt.txt> @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#womrxga) O-o, you are? That would be great, really. I have been pondering about replacing my locally hosted feed by this one by cron'ing a wget or something like that...
2022-05-07T23:11:33Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> (#opev6mq) Imagine I want to stop updating my feed on my domain.com by starting a new feed at coolerdomain.net, but point to the previous one in its previous address, for history purposes.  Or maybe I want to stop using this pod because I think I like yours best, or I host my own now... so I want to *continue* there, pointing to this as my previous one.
2022-05-07T23:26:31Z	(#vp2aicq) @<marado https://feeds.twtxt.net/marcos-marado-atmind_booster/twtxt.txt> Now I just need to know what does the twtxt community do in lieu of RT...
2022-05-07T23:31:40Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#nsmsvfq) Nitter's RSS solves the issue! I'd probably advocate for replacing the current (not working) Twitter import option with it! Sure, you get dependent on a 3rd party, but it avoids all the "hypocrisy" questions! ;-)
2022-05-07T23:32:45Z	@<tkanos https://twtxt.net/user/tkanos/twtxt.txt> @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#womrxga) Awesome, looking forward to use it!
2022-05-07T23:40:27Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#vp2aicq) ReTweet... Two common things I miss here from  twitter: RTs and <3's.
2022-05-07T23:48:18Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#opev6mq) Spoofing is always possible, and always a concern (don't we "deal" with it already for the url field?).  For the side-question, the feature is nice but depends on availability, and trust, I'm more interested in adversarial interoperability. What if I'm moving from a pod because I dislike their new policies, or new terms of service, their monetization model, etc.? And what guarantees do we have that every pod (or even yarn implementation) will have the redirect option available to its users?
2022-05-07T23:54:43Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#nsmsvfq) Apparently, nitter "Uses Twitter's unofficial API (no rate limits or developer account required)", so I suppose you could run your own instance and not depend on a 3rd party, or even just see on nitter's code (it's free software!) thev relevant parts of that 'unofficial API'...
2022-05-08T00:04:20Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#vp2aicq) It's a hint: it nudges my feed's followers "hey read this twtxt in another feed". We can probably find a better way to implement these hints or nudges, but if there's nothing in place, I wonder if we won't end up with a bunch of twtxts just saying "agree" or "+1"...
2022-05-08T01:15:34Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#nsmsvfq) https://github.com/zedeus/nitter
2022-05-08T10:28:41Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> (#opev6mq) That's the scenario, yes. Importing twtxt feeds seems like a good functionality, but it doesn't totally replace (or exaust) the scenarios in which one could want to have their "prev, static twtxt file" on a different path/subdomain/etc...
2022-05-08T22:59:38Z	@<kevin https://om.gd/twtxt.txt> (#2emlw4q) is it just me, or BBS access via telnet oh.mg (port 23) isn't working?
2022-05-09T01:27:55Z	@<slashdot https://feeds.twtxt.net/slashdot/twtxt.txt> (#ehjdwbq) Just one more (high profile) case.  Mandating a return to the office, instead of not letting workers decide what works best for them is, at the very least, shortsighted.
2022-05-10T00:06:51Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> (#opev6mq) That would be a scenario, yes.
2022-05-10T23:09:55Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#opev6mq) I think so, yes. More generically, places were you have no control over the webserver (hosting services via ssh/ftp without htaccess support is another example).
2022-05-10T23:22:47Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#opev6mq) I see reasons for allowing absolute URIs, and see no reason not to.  I suppose I should condense this thread into a write-up proposing the change, explaining why, and proposing client behaviors ("how to deal with a prev pointing to an absolute URI"). But that takes time, and I don't know when will I reserve some to sit down and actually do the proposal :-)
2022-05-11T23:43:04Z	@<hacker-news https://feeds.twtxt.net/hacker-news/twtxt.txt> @<ullarah https://devtxt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt> (#blbqsda) Correct: CUDA remains closed source, so these new open source kernel modules remain useless if you want to use only free software. The good part of it is that it will "serve as a reference to help improve the Nouveau driver."

2022-05-28T19:13:30Z	Estou de regresso à escrita, e à Ficção Científica.  Desta vez, participo com um pequeno conto para o livro "Lamego 2022 - o antes e o depois", uma colectânia de textos nos mais variados formatos e estilos, que olha para a cidade onde nasci - não só como ela é hoje, mas na sua História passada e história futura.  O lançamento deste livro vai ser já no próximo dia 5 de Junho, enquadrado no festival "[Lamego Cidade Poema](https://www.cm-lamego.pt/home/noticias/1909-lamego-cidade-poema-regressa-ao-formato-presencial)".
2022-05-29T23:22:06Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> (#enmfm3a) I have thought of different approaches, each have strengths and weaknesses. Mostly, I'd like to know what others think :-) In any case, I suppose I'd like to "extend" the hashtag generation API, so each blog post can have its own thread hash tag (like twts do). Then, "listing" the comments could be via querying a registry, and the "leave a comment" link could link to https://preconfigured-yarn.pod/?newtwt=@blogowner%20(#hashtag) or whatever link that would open that pod ready to create that new post if you're logged in. Bonus points if you can configure more than one pod and it displays a dropdown; more bonus if we decide to implement twt:// uris letting twt clients listen to those (including a browser plug-in letting you say 'open twt:// uris on https://my.pod').  Yes, I might be overengineering.

2022-10-05T01:40:57Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#ixg4xta) tbh, as a maintainer participation only makes sense if your projects are already hosted either in github or gitlab - or if you are starting a new project. In any case, there is still plenty of time to participate!
2022-10-22T13:15:16Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#5mantaq) there's a new version: https://www.instructables.com/ArduinoPhone-20-an-Open-Source-Mobile-Phone-Based-/
2022-10-29T00:08:21Z	@<slashdot https://feeds.twtxt.net/slashdot/twtxt.txt> (#pm6usia) Too bad the article doesn't remind us that the original target date (when we still didn't know how bad things really are) was [2030](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-autos-denmark-idUSKBN1WJ1YW)... But sure, let's pretend the EU is doing something brave, just a couple of days after being warned they're far from planning to do enough (#<mlqubkq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=mlqubkq>)...
2022-10-29T00:27:56Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#pm6usia) yes, both point to the same "no credible pathway **in place**", which is to say that... finally approving a watered-down measure is not something we should applaud, as, in order to still manage 1.5C, we need more, stronger measures.
2022-10-30T15:26:28Z	Hi @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>, question regarding responsible use of twtxt.net's services. How much is "too intensive" an use of its endpoints? For eg, an "every minute" fetch of a twt feed is considered OK? (I honestly have no idea about the default frequency of communication between pods and all that...)
2022-10-30T15:47:48Z	For those that might be a little bit lost regarding my twtxt presence: * I host my own twtxt feed [here](https://tilde.pt/~marado/twtxt.txt) so I can remain independent of 3rd party providers, and "owner of my own feed". However; * Currently my feed is being generated and managed at [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net/user/marado), which allows me, amongst other things, to use [goryon](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/app), a nice mobile app, to manage my feed (even if twtxt.net's web interface works pretty well on mobile); * On a geeky sidenote, I haven't still set aside the idea of running my own single-user yarn pod instead of relying on twtxt.net, but I didn't want to postpone this movement any longer, now that there's a new twitter exodus; * For historic purposes, you can still find my old twtxts on the old feed, now rotated into a [new address](https://tilde.pt/~marado/twtxt-2021.txt); * Finally, there's still a twtxt feed of [my tweets](https://feeds.twtxt.net/marcos-marado-atmind_booster/twtxt.txt).
2022-10-30T15:56:31Z	(#e2ddupa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I'm listening... what does that provide beyond what I can get with a cron'd wget?
2022-10-30T16:02:07Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#e2ddupa) not a priority for me right now, but that's useful, thanks for the tip!
