2021-01-28T13:59:43Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<nkrjalq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=nkrjalq>) Cool! I haven't followed what has been going on in twtland for a while. Can you please share links to jenny and tt?
2021-11-09T20:02:52Z	Goryon - the twtxt mobile app - is making me think about hosting a yarn pod - just so I can use it while keeping my (real, self-hosted) twtxt "account". I wonder if there's an easy way to host a lightweight, single-user version of the endpoint… or if there's documentation about how to write one.
2021-11-10T10:38:16Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#hfal6kq) So, there is an API! This is offtopic for the thread (sorry) but can you link me to its documentation? I'm thinking about creating a single-user barebones "pod", compatible with the mobile app but that manages a single twtxt file.
2021-11-10T20:02:01Z	@<darch https://twtxt.net/user/darch/twtxt.txt> (#hzrblbq) Great stuff, thanks! That does solve my "publishing" part of the equation, even if it still doesn't work as a client (either web or mobile)…
2021-11-10T20:37:02Z	@lyse @<darch https://twtxt.net/user/darch/twtxt.txt> @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> @<thecanine https://twtxt.net/user/thecanine/twtxt.txt> @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#hfal6kq) Seems to me that the sync is only useful if it allows a lot more editing (eventually even a complete rewrite). Which I am all for, but then the edit/deletion restriction on the UI becomes sort of an hassle, as someone more tech-savvy will be able to do things that less tech-savvy users will not…
2021-11-11T10:47:29Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#hzrblbq) yes, functionally an yarnd with --single-user is all/exactly what I'm seeking.  Technically I'd then probably still want a port/clone of it into a lighter-weight, easilly hostable alternative (so you can file-drop into any tilde host, or even those FTP-only hostings…), but that's a bridge to cross when I get there…
2021-11-11T22:12:48Z	@lyse @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> (#te2mlfa) damn, now I'm sad that the way they do it doesn't really follow the twtxt format…

2022-04-25T18:53:29Z	According to some on twitter (see https://twitter.com/disclosetv/status/1518662153343057923?t=HAwtAoxkxZ-H6E8Px7qq1w&s=19 as an example), twitter share trading has halted, and the announcement of Musk buying Twitter is imminent.  I'm a little disappointed to not see more people talking about twtxt as an alternative to twitter…

2022-05-07T00:32:14Z	Hey @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>, https://dev.twtxt.net/doc/archivefeedsextension.html allows only for a prev filename but not a full URL. Is there any reason why? Even for non-self-hosters, being able to point to a new domain would be good for interoperability, right?
2022-05-07T09:22:51Z	(#opev6mq) I'm uncertain I'm looking at the right place, but from how I read it, absolute URLs not only aren't mandated, they aren't even a possibility. I'll open a PR soon(TM)
2022-05-07T09:33:50Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> here's another question (sorry!), is something wrong going on with the feeds service? https://feeds.twtxt.net/twitter-mind_booster/twtxt.txt does not seem to be updated since January (but the source is...)
2022-05-07T10:12:07Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#nsmsvfq) 😥 It might be worth doing it via twitter's API... but since I'm not volunteering to implement it, I'll just remain sad :-P
2022-05-07T23:02:26Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> (#nsmsvfq) awesome tip!
2022-05-07T23:06:42Z	@<anx https://twtxt.net/user/anx/twtxt.txt> @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#womrxga) O-o, you are? That would be great, really. I have been pondering about replacing my locally hosted feed by this one by cron'ing a wget or something like that...
2022-05-07T23:11:33Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> (#opev6mq) Imagine I want to stop updating my feed on my domain.com by starting a new feed at coolerdomain.net, but point to the previous one in its previous address, for history purposes.  Or maybe I want to stop using this pod because I think I like yours best, or I host my own now... so I want to *continue* there, pointing to this as my previous one.
2022-05-07T23:26:31Z	(#vp2aicq) @<marado https://feeds.twtxt.net/marcos-marado-atmind_booster/twtxt.txt> Now I just need to know what does the twtxt community do in lieu of RT...
2022-05-07T23:31:40Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#nsmsvfq) Nitter's RSS solves the issue! I'd probably advocate for replacing the current (not working) Twitter import option with it! Sure, you get dependent on a 3rd party, but it avoids all the "hypocrisy" questions! ;-)
2022-05-07T23:32:45Z	@<tkanos https://twtxt.net/user/tkanos/twtxt.txt> @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#womrxga) Awesome, looking forward to use it!
2022-05-07T23:40:27Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#vp2aicq) ReTweet... Two common things I miss here from  twitter: RTs and <3's.
2022-05-07T23:48:18Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#opev6mq) Spoofing is always possible, and always a concern (don't we "deal" with it already for the url field?).  For the side-question, the feature is nice but depends on availability, and trust, I'm more interested in adversarial interoperability. What if I'm moving from a pod because I dislike their new policies, or new terms of service, their monetization model, etc.? And what guarantees do we have that every pod (or even yarn implementation) will have the redirect option available to its users?
2022-05-07T23:54:43Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#nsmsvfq) Apparently, nitter "Uses Twitter's unofficial API (no rate limits or developer account required)", so I suppose you could run your own instance and not depend on a 3rd party, or even just see on nitter's code (it's free software!) thev relevant parts of that 'unofficial API'...
2022-05-08T00:04:20Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#vp2aicq) It's a hint: it nudges my feed's followers "hey read this twtxt in another feed". We can probably find a better way to implement these hints or nudges, but if there's nothing in place, I wonder if we won't end up with a bunch of twtxts just saying "agree" or "+1"...
2022-05-08T01:15:34Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#nsmsvfq) https://github.com/zedeus/nitter
2022-05-08T10:28:41Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> (#opev6mq) That's the scenario, yes. Importing twtxt feeds seems like a good functionality, but it doesn't totally replace (or exaust) the scenarios in which one could want to have their "prev, static twtxt file" on a different path/subdomain/etc...
2022-05-08T22:59:38Z	@<kevin https://om.gd/twtxt.txt> (#2emlw4q) is it just me, or BBS access via telnet oh.mg (port 23) isn't working?
2022-05-09T01:27:55Z	@<slashdot https://feeds.twtxt.net/slashdot/twtxt.txt> (#ehjdwbq) Just one more (high profile) case.  Mandating a return to the office, instead of not letting workers decide what works best for them is, at the very least, shortsighted.
2022-05-10T00:06:51Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> (#opev6mq) That would be a scenario, yes.
2022-05-10T23:09:55Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#opev6mq) I think so, yes. More generically, places were you have no control over the webserver (hosting services via ssh/ftp without htaccess support is another example).
2022-05-10T23:22:47Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#opev6mq) I see reasons for allowing absolute URIs, and see no reason not to.  I suppose I should condense this thread into a write-up proposing the change, explaining why, and proposing client behaviors ("how to deal with a prev pointing to an absolute URI"). But that takes time, and I don't know when will I reserve some to sit down and actually do the proposal :-)
2022-05-11T23:43:04Z	@<hacker-news https://feeds.twtxt.net/hacker-news/twtxt.txt> @<ullarah https://devtxt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt> (#blbqsda) Correct: CUDA remains closed source, so these new open source kernel modules remain useless if you want to use only free software. The good part of it is that it will "serve as a reference to help improve the Nouveau driver."

2022-05-15T00:26:05Z	I've just realized Diablo has made 25 years (a quarter of a century!) in January.

2022-05-28T19:13:30Z	Estou de regresso à escrita, e à Ficção Científica.  Desta vez, participo com um pequeno conto para o livro "Lamego 2022 - o antes e o depois", uma colectânia de textos nos mais variados formatos e estilos, que olha para a cidade onde nasci - não só como ela é hoje, mas na sua História passada e história futura.  O lançamento deste livro vai ser já no próximo dia 5 de Junho, enquadrado no festival "[Lamego Cidade Poema](https://www.cm-lamego.pt/home/noticias/1909-lamego-cidade-poema-regressa-ao-formato-presencial)".
2022-05-29T23:22:06Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> (#enmfm3a) I have thought of different approaches, each have strengths and weaknesses. Mostly, I'd like to know what others think :-) In any case, I suppose I'd like to "extend" the hashtag generation API, so each blog post can have its own thread hash tag (like twts do). Then, "listing" the comments could be via querying a registry, and the "leave a comment" link could link to https://preconfigured-yarn.pod/?newtwt=@blogowner%20(#hashtag) or whatever link that would open that pod ready to create that new post if you're logged in. Bonus points if you can configure more than one pod and it displays a dropdown; more bonus if we decide to implement twt:// uris letting twt clients listen to those (including a browser plug-in letting you say 'open twt:// uris on https://my.pod').  Yes, I might be overengineering.

2022-10-30T15:26:28Z	Hi @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>, question regarding responsible use of twtxt.net's services. How much is "too intensive" an use of its endpoints? For eg, an "every minute" fetch of a twt feed is considered OK? (I honestly have no idea about the default frequency of communication between pods and all that...)
2022-10-30T15:47:48Z	For those that might be a little bit lost regarding my twtxt presence: * I host my own twtxt feed [here](https://tilde.pt/~marado/twtxt.txt) so I can remain independent of 3rd party providers, and "owner of my own feed". However; * Currently my feed is being generated and managed at [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net/user/marado), which allows me, amongst other things, to use [goryon](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/app), a nice mobile app, to manage my feed (even if twtxt.net's web interface works pretty well on mobile); * On a geeky sidenote, I haven't still set aside the idea of running my own single-user yarn pod instead of relying on twtxt.net, but I didn't want to postpone this movement any longer, now that there's a new twitter exodus; * For historic purposes, you can still find my old twtxts on the old feed, now rotated into a [new address](https://tilde.pt/~marado/twtxt-2021.txt); * Finally, there's still a twtxt feed of [my tweets](https://feeds.twtxt.net/marcos-marado-atmind_booster/twtxt.txt).

While the redirect option is nice to have, I still feel it might not be enough, specially since it depends on the support of the poderator. Having the possibility to point a new feed to a specific old one would help (ie, prev allowing full URIs instead of relative paths, and pods letting users define their feeds prev).  Sorry I'm pulling this topic into an already complex thread ;-), specially when I was supposed to write a proposal for this change, and never did (yet?)...

In any case, removals must be implemented somehow (at least in pods operating under EU law), so there's no downside in implementing it with a redirect option.  Regarding `# prev`, maybe it is best to recover the old thread (which I think was (#<opev6mq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=opev6mq>)).

2022-10-31T11:18:49Z	As in standards,  it would actually be healthy for the twtxt network if it became heterogeneous, with pods running competing implementations (yarn and something else) of the protocol. Perhaps we're not there yet, but I suppose we should design taking that into account...

Thus, I'd argue that there is nothing against extending the spec to also allow full paths: current users are unnafected, and we'd be catering for new/other use cases.  Yes, I do realize that would mean this would have to go into a new version of the spec, and clients would have to implement it in order to comply with the new version of the spec.

2022-11-06T16:23:14Z	There are many interesting things to observe in this recent Twitter exodus (and the boost it is giving to Mastodon's adoption). One of them is that I haven't read even once yet about someone who's "leaving Twitter for Facebook" or something like that: officially, Facebook is no longer a "social media alternative" to Twitter users.
2022-11-06T17:59:03Z	One of the things that attracts me about the "twtxt social network" is how radically decentralized it is. Not only each user is its own node (maintaining its own text file feed), there's no limits to the protocols used to access each feed. Sure, most of the feeds are probably being served over http or https, but there are feeds being served over gopher, and I bet some of them over ftp/ftps. But it doesn't have to be that way - feeds can be distributed in any modern equivalent to the sneakernet, you can save yours in a usb stick or a floppy disk, hand it over by hand or send it via postal mail; you can distributed them on a mailing list, on the usernet... The limit is your imagination. This reflection made me realize that there's no reason to wait for secushare, twtxt feeds can already be used, shared, maintained and spread on GNUnet, taking this social media platform to the GNU Internet.
2022-11-06T18:39:47Z	Thinking about reviving (#<xi7nivq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=xi7nivq>) - the idea of managing bashblog comments with twtxt instead of leading people to Twitter.

2022-11-07T00:32:20Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#xd7fidq) I was thinking more on something along the lines of the current twitter "integration", but now that I think more about it, I realize that [darch's suggestion](https://neotxt.dk/twt/flsa37q) has more merit than what I initially realized. The blog comments system can be a twtxt feed, each entry a new twt/hash, each user comment referring to that hash.
2022-11-08T01:20:18Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#xd7fidq) tbf, microblogs as comment systems might just be a wrong idea. I was led towards it by the current twitter implementation on bashblog (which I use), but the more I think about it the more I suspect that it just is the wrong tool for the job.

2022-11-19T23:55:38Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#u7lvl4q) Well, basically I refer to a "radical decentralization", with twtxt you don't *need* to host a pod or maintain any software, nor rely on any 3rd parties, you can simply manage a text file, and make it available however works best for you. It provides a quite refreshing sort of independence I mostly miss from the internet of decades ago. Mastodon is nice, but it doesn't give you /that/.

It came out as a 2CD installation, even if it was quite common to find one-CD editions of it being shipped with magazines and used all around.

But the fact that, in reaction to it, an WA spokesperson says that this makes no sense because "this case concerns a privacy policy from four years ago that has since been updated" only shows the sense of impunity big tech feels, as well as how ridiculous it is that they are able to drag these things for so long. In the meantime, they keep violating the law (just yesterday Meta lost three other GDPR-related cases!), and with no end in sight - even today's WA case is far from over, with appeals ongoing and more chances for appeal available. A sour-tasting victory, today's.

But sure, I can see how reading these feeds might be frustrating: too big posts, markdown everywhere, linebreak characters, emojis... But I'll consider it the "freedom of the user" to decide whether or not to follow a feed written in a certain style. The provocative metadata comment? Easy (and better) to just ignore.

I'm not sure I can agree to all of it, but I certainly can understand the point of view. Curiously, what appears to have been the tipping point is also something I believe we can and should fix: hashtags. 1/2

This makes things unreadable and seems totally unnecessary. Shouldn't this be a client feature? Why should my feed have a link to a search engine instead of a hashtag? And why can't the client (when it is a visual client like goryon or the web) react to hashtags (all of them) by linking to a search interface? Am I missing something?

I have wanted to read some Aldiss for a good while, but the first of his books I've read ([Cryptozoic!](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Age)), while an entertaining reading, didn't really convince me to the point of making me want to seek more of his books. But now, several years later, I was browsing a book called [501 Must Read Books](https://www.librarything.com/work/1888246/book/231625245) and Hothouse was there... at the spur of the moment I checked on the local library's catalog and the book was there so I decided to grab it, then I've read it's wikipedia page and started second guessing the decision... and now that I've started reading it, I'm quite enjoying it. Who knows if my thoughts will change again before I finish it!

As for identity leakage, do notice that only author patch info is present - a name (that can be a pseudonym) and an address field that can be empty. Other then that you only have the transport means, but you don't really need to use e-mail if that is your concern, you can for eg. set up an anonymous ftp... you just need to get the formatted patches, git not having its own transport is not a limitation but the freedom to let you get patches in any way you want! ;-)
